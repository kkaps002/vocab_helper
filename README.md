# vocab_helper
 A vocabulary learing tool to help me study German.

 In this project I have mainly focused on using pure JS and taking advantage of the local Storage method. The styling is minimal and it is generally concering providing feedback appropriate feedback while using the tool.

 The tool works in two parts. First, the user must provide words and their translation using the keyboard. They are then stored in the list which is displayed and is updated everytime a new word is added to the desired list of words that the user would like to learn on that session. I have also included the ability to delete the last input or clear the entire list. When the user is happy with their list, they can press the START TEST button which will move them to the second part.

 The second part, which is the vocabulary test, shows a random translation from the list of words provided from the user and allows them to type an answer in an input field. Depending on their answer, a "Correct !" or "Wrong." message appears on the page. I have also included a counter that shows how many of the words have been currently tested and at the end a final score appears.

 This project was helpful in getting me comfortable with DOM Manipulation, handling local storage as well as creating and calling my own JS functions.
